# Tetris
This is my Tetris implementation that started as a passion project and an addition to the portfolio. It's mostly meant to serve as programming practice, but I got somewhat hooked and had to tune many details to make the playing experience smoother. I've also come to greatly appreciate Tetris as a game, so I wanted to make something that works well, at least for casual players. Here's a preview:

Potential improvements would be further enhancing the game experience, perhaps creating a light database to store highscores, adding music, a game over screen, local multiplayer, modes like 40 lines, 2 minutes etc. Also, a bot can be trained to play. There's some groundwork that's been done, but no huge steps have been taken. 

To try out the game at this stage, you'll need to run the code from your machine with all the necessary modules and Python - development version was 3.10, but there should be backwards compatibility. Have fun!

Controls can be found and changed in the code, but by default left and right arrows move the current piece left and right respectively, up or x rotate clockwise, z rotates counter-clockwise, down arrow moves the piece down, and spacebar drops it all the way immediately.
